How can the babysitter know lots of things about the baby’s safety? Caring for young children is not easy. When the parents leave, the babysitter is responsible for keeping that child safe, fed and entertained. If there has been no prior formal training or education, how can these babysitting skills be improved? By reading books on the subject, Through online research and reading articles on the internet? In aviation, we can call this resource of information “documentation”.'),\n",

[Bill] In about an hour. [Ann], Do not make me laugh. [Bill] That's the first time we've ever had a conversation using this system. [Margaret] In order to communicate in her day-to-day life, she has an assistive communication device. These are dollar store glasses And she interfaces with it using a little reflective sticker on them. It's very slow and the device now is very old, but she relies on it. [Bill] For us to have that conversation using her Dynavox would probably be like a 5-to-7-minute conversation. [Ann] It was nice to have a conversation. I forget how slow this machine is. [Margaret] When Ann was 30 years old, she was playing volleyball with some friends and had a stroke which led to the condition that she has now, which is locked-in syndrome. At this point she had a 6-month-old child and a 7-year-old child. [Ann] You are truly wonderful people. [Margaret] The physicians have no idea why this happened. That was now 18 years ago. How can we create technology that can help people really meaningfully contribute with all sorts of abilities? [Ann] Hi, How are things going?\"),\n",

Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Sanghyun Lee and his team of University of Michigan researchers are placing inexpensive wearable sensors on construction workers to measure anxiety, fatigue and heat stress while on the job. >> Gaang Lee. I worked at construction company for five years. Our research can help them to be safe. [construction site sounds]. Per day we will check their perceived heat stress and perceived fatigue four times. >> Narrator. The sensors will read body movement, temperature and electrodermal responses, while saliva samples verify some of the incoming data. The goal is to use the sensors to establish a model that will help predict when workers will become dehydrated, anxious or when accidental falls are most likely to occur. >> Harris. We're seeing that some of the guys are staying in the field longer. You know they're wearing their bodies out, given the type of work that they do and as we move along through this project, I wouldn't be surprised, five, ten years down the road, that some of the research that these guys are doing here today has changes in the way that we do things in the field in the future.
